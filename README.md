# 11785 - Deep-Learning-Algorithms

This repository is for the deep learning algorithms implemented as part of course 11-785 Intro to Deep Learning

Deatils of each implementation is in the form of pdf in each folder

## MLP-BatchNorm
A Multi Layered Percepteron with activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh and RelU is implemented using the Python-Numpy. Also,  softmax cross entropy loss function and batch norm function is implemented using Python-Numpy.

## Convolution Neural Networks
Numpy based convoluytionneural net library is implemented

## Gated Recurrent Units and Beam search
Numpy based Gated Recurrent Unit and Beam Search algorithm is implemented.

## Recurrent Neural Network based language model
develop and training a recurrent neural network on the WikiText-2 language modeling dataset. This uses a recurrent network to model and generate text. This gives pipeline to properly construct, train, and regularize an LSTM language model
